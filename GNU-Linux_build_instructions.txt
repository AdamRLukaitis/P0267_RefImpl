You will need a relatively recent build of GNU autotools. Any recent distro
should have a reasonably new version available which will fit the needs here.
You will also need cairo, GTK+3, and related libraries; as long as you have
autotools, if you should be able to generate a configure script and it will
tell you if you are missing any other dependencies.

To build the project, from this directory run the command 'autoreconf -i'. It
should run for a bit then complete silently. If so, you should then run the
generated './configure' script. This should notify you if you are missing any
pre-reqs or have an older version that wouldn't work. If configure completes
successfully, you should be able to run the 'make' command and then execute
the resulting executable by calling './N3888_RefImpl/src/N3888_RefImpl'.

The drawing portion is the same code as in the Windows version. The entry
point uses GTK+3 and is quite rough currently (very C-like complete with
*shudder* global variables). It is meant as a demonstration only and will
improve as time allows.
