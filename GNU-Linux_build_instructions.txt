You will need a relatively recent build of GNU autotools. Any recent distro
should have a reasonably new version available which will fit the needs here.

You will also need cairo version 1.12.14 or newer and libjpeg-turbo (note: on 
Ubuntu it's called libturbojpeg, maybe on other distros). To support PNG
functionality, you need libpng 1.6.X or later.

This has been tested with Clang 4.0 and the version of libc++ that accompanies 
it. It will likely work with GCC 7 and the version of libstdc++ that 
accompanies it. The reason is that it requires std::variant, std::optional, 
and various other library features that are only in C++.

To build the project, from this directory run the command 'autoreconf -i'. It
should run for a bit then complete silently. If so, you should then run the
generated './configure' script with any necessary parameters. This should
notify you if you are missing any pre-requisites or have an older version that
won't work. If configure completes successfully, you should be able to run the
'make' command and then execute the resulting executable by calling
the './N3888_RefImpl/src/N3888_RefImpl' executable. In sample_draw.cpp, the 
test_image_load_and_save function will only work if you run N3888_RefImpl from 
the N3888_RefImpl/src/ directory since it uses relative paths to load the 
images it uses.

By default it will build using Xlib. You can use Xcb by passing the 
"--enable-xcb" option to configure.

The "run-configure-with-*" shell scripts are provided as examples only. They 
are used for my personal testing. Like everything else, they are subject to 
the terms of LICENSE.md.
